# Hotel Review Classification
This Hotel Review Classification project is an exploration of deep learning techniques to analyze and categorize hotel reviews into negative, neutral, and positive sentiments. In this endeavor, I meticulously followed a structured workflow, commencing with data preprocessing and vectorization using **TF-IDF**. The neural network model was optimized using the RMSProp optimizer.

To evaluate model performance comprehensively, I visualized the loss and area under the curve (AUC) for in-depth analysis. The development of the **neural network model** was guided by a strategic evaluation protocol, starting with a holdout method, and further enhanced by regularization techniquesâ€”specifically dropout, and L1 or L2 regularization.

In my pursuit of an optimized model, I combined both dropout and regularization methods to achieve superior performance. Rigorous evaluation using k-fold cross-validation allowed me to identify the best model, boasting an impressive **accuracy of 83%**, **precision of 0.7**, and a **recall of 0.72**. Additionally, I utilized the confusion matrix to provide a detailed breakdown of predictions, enriching my understanding of the model's effectiveness in sentiment analysis.
