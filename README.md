# Hotel Review Classification
This Hotel Review Classification project, a deep learning venture aimed at analyzing and categorizing hotel reviews into negative, neutral, and positive sentiments. This innovative project involved a comprehensive workflow, starting with data preprocessing and vectorization using TF-IDF. The model optimization was meticulously approached by selecting RMSProp as the optimizer.

To assess model performance, I plotted loss and area under the curve (AUC) for critical analysis. The development of the model was structured using a strategic evaluation protocol, beginning with a holdout method and followed by regularization techniquesâ€”specifically dropout, and L1 or L2 regularization.

Combining both methods, I sought to achieve an optimized model. Through rigorous evaluation utilizing k-fold cross-validation, I identified the best model, boasting an impressive accuracy of 83%, precision of 0.7, and a recall of 0.72. Additionally, I utilized the confusion matrix to provide a detailed breakdown of predictions, enhancing my understanding of the model's effectiveness in sentiment analysis.
